**Thesis Project Disclosure**
Dear Users,

I would like to inform you that the SeaYou web application is a project developed as part of a graduate thesis. This web app represents a culmination of academic efforts aimed at exploring and applying concepts related to full-stack web development.

The SeaYou web app is built using Django, a high-level web framework in Python, and is supported by a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired during the course of the graduate degree.

While every effort has been made to ensure the functionality and reliability of the SeaYou web app, please be aware that it is primarily a learning and research project. As such, it may not possess the same level of robustness as commercially developed applications.

I appreciate your understanding and welcome any constructive feedback you may have. Your engagement with the SeaYou web app contributes to the ongoing refinement of this thesis project.

Thank you for your interest and support.
Sincerely,

Nathalie
